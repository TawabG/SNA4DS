\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\hypertarget{main-topic}{%
\subsubsection{Main topic}\label{main-topic}}

In this paper, we are going to study the presence of social networks
within a movie streaming platform. We're focusing on the structure of
links among a group of social players, which consist of users watching
and rating movies on Netflix.\\
Users of Netflix's movie recommendation algorithms are frequently given
specific questions about their interests for certain items (which they
provide by liking or disliking them, for example). These choices are
then immediately integrated into the underlying learning system for
future suggestions. If a recommender system starts promoting unwanted
products after incorporating new preferences, the user may try to steer
the system in the future by correcting it or supplying alternate
preference information.

\hypertarget{importance}{%
\subsubsection{Importance}\label{importance}}

It is important to study the presence of these socials networks because
this could potentially improve the recommender engine that this
currently in place. For example, if you know that a user is likely to
like a movie that other users with the same ``liking profile'' also
like, you can recommend that movie to the user. When these connections
are studied thoroughly, you could have a high probability that the
recommendation is successful. This could have a large impact on a movie
streaming platform.

\hypertarget{existing-studies}{%
\subsubsection{Existing studies}\label{existing-studies}}

In this paper, we will be looking into the Netflix Price Dataset. In
2006 Netflix decided to start a competition with a grand prize of 1
million US dollars. The goal of the competition was to create a
collaborative filtering algorithm to predict user ratings for films,
based on previous ratings without any other information about the users
or films. In order to win you had to at least improve on Netflix's own
algorithm by 10\%. During the competition a lot of literature has
emerged about the dataset and the competition. (Bell and Koren 2007;
Tak√°cs et al. 2008; Narayanan and Shmatikov 2006)

However, no papers or any other literature can be found on network
analysis on this dataset. We like to fill this gap in the literature by
analysing the network and network structure that arises from the subset
of the data that we will use. (Guillory and Bilmes 2011) developed an
active movie recommendation system for Netflix. They found that a
recommender system should not constantly ask questions to a user,
because those reduces the user's mental image of how the recommendation
system learns, prompting some participants to ``lose track of what they
were teaching.'' According to Amershi et al. (2014), this was because
users are not always eager to act as simple oracles (repeatedly telling
the recommendation system whether they like something or not). This is
interesting to take into account for our research, because this would
mean that a social network within a movie recommendation system can
never be fully exposed.

\hypertarget{research-questions-and-hypotheses}{%
\subsubsection{Research Questions and
hypotheses}\label{research-questions-and-hypotheses}}

In this dataset, we can easily see connections between users and movies,
but not between just the users or just the movies. At least not, when we
do not include one or the other. That is why we have defined the
following research questions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  RQ1: What are the effects of the genre on the likelihood of having
  both movies watched by the same user?
\item
  RQ2: How much does liking the same movies influence disliking the same
  movies, and vice versa? (In a network of frequent reviewers)
\end{itemize}

In order to be able to answer these research questions, we have made set
up the following hypothesis accordingly:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Research Question 1:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Comparable movies, in terms of either genre and/or year, are more
    often watched by the same user than uncomparable movies.\\
  \item
    Movies of genre horror are generally rated higher than other movie
    genres.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Research Question 2:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Users that like the same movies to a certain degree, are likely to
    dislike the same movies to that same degree
  \item
    Users that dislike the same movies to a certain degree, are likely
    to like the same movies to that same degree
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{methodology}{%
\subsection{Methodology}\label{methodology}}

\hypertarget{dataset}{%
\subsubsection{Dataset}\label{dataset}}

The primary dataset that is being used during this study is provided by
Netflix (REF: KAGGLE) . Netflix shared this data for the Netflix Prize
competition where people could use the data to improve their recomender
system for movies. The data includes ratings for 17770 movies from
480189 users. In total, it contains around 24 million ratings on a scale
from one to five and the date of the rating. For the movies, the dataset
only contains the title of the movie and the year it was released. This
was too little information about the movies for our project. Therefore,
we decided to look for an additional data source to enrich the dataset.
We used Amazon Prime movie genres to add genres to the dataset for
further analysis.

The large size of the dataset made it difficult to work with and made
running analysis models infeasable. Therefore, we decided to only use a
selection of the ratings. The dataset has ratings from October 1998 to
December 2005. For this analysis, only the data from December 2001,
Januari 2002, and februari 2002 are considered. We chose this winter
because this is the first time where users started to rate a good amount
of movies while the number of ratings still did not completely explode
yet.

To answer our two research questions we had to transform our data
further in two different ways. For the first research question, the
network is defined as movies for the nodes and the movies have an edge
between them if there is an user that likes both movies. Liking a movie
is defined as a user giving a 4 or 5 rating for a movie. Of course,
modelling the network this way means that movies that are highly rated
are always connect. Therefore, the network only included movies that
have between 20 and 50 ratings. That means that our analysis only
concerns niche movies with a small number of ratings. Moreover, there is
a lower threshold too to make sure that we only include movies that have
at least a few connections. All in all, the network is just under 500
nodes and the attributes for the nodes are the year of release of the
movie and the main movie genre that comes from Amazon Prime.

\hypertarget{descriptives}{%
\paragraph{Descriptives}\label{descriptives}}

Looking at the average Rating of the users in the data, the average
rating they gave was about a \(3,36\).

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|r|r|r|r|r}
\hline
  & mean & sd & min & max & n\\
\hline
Rating & 3.362346 & 1.114827 & 1 & 5 & 864610\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Looking at the histogram of the amound of ratings given on a certain
date we can see that a peak in ratings exists always in the middle of
the week (around wednesday/thursday). Looking at the distribution of the
ratings over time we don't see great differences. Over time, people give
consistent ratings.

\includegraphics{SNA4DSprojectReport_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-5-1.pdf}

The genres in the data were determined using Amazone Prime. The first
genre that Amazone Prime displayed is taken as the genre of the movie.
As the genres that were displayed in Amazone Prime were not on
alfabethic order, we assume that the first genre given is the main
genre. 20 genres were found in the Netflix dataset. Most of the movies
had \emph{comedy} or \emph{drama} as genre.

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{qap}{%
\paragraph{QAP}\label{qap}}

In general, QAP is very interesting, when you have two or more networks
and wants to compare those. In addition, we also choose QAP regression,
since we thought it would be interesting to use this model, based on its
permutation of actually observed graphs and therefore staying closer to
the nature of our networks.

There are three different QAP models from which one had to be chosen for
our data and research question. The first is the simple QAP test where
you measure the association between two networks. Furthermore, there is
a QAP linear model, which can be used on a valued dependent network and
one or more explanatory networks. Finally, there is the QAP logistic
model, which differs from the linear model, in terms of a binary-valued
dependent network.

Our weights in our network are not binary so the logistic model is not
an option for us. Even though, we only have two networks we decided to
go for the linear model since we would like to see if we could
``explain'' the first network with the second and vice versa.

\hypertarget{ergm}{%
\paragraph{ERGM}\label{ergm}}

Many metrics like density and centrality are used to describe the
structural characteristics of an observed network. These metrics, on the
other hand, describe the observed network, which is just one of many
possible alternative networks. The structural characteristics of this
group of alternative networks may or may not be similar. A statistical
model must consider the set of all possible alternative networks
weighted in their similarity to an observed network to credit a
statistical inference about the processes that influence the formation
of network structures.

Network data, on the other hand, violates the independence and identical
distribution assumptions of statistical models like linear regression
because they are inherently relational. Alternative statistical models
must reflect the uncertainty associated with a given observation and
allow inference about the relative frequency of theoretically important
network substructures. Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM) help with
this.

Using ERGMs is a powerful technique for conducting statistical inference
on network data. ERGMs are a good choice as a network modelling
framework for cases where the outcome of interest is in the presence or
absence of edges.

\hypertarget{constructing-data-and-the-model}{%
\paragraph{Constructing data and the
model}\label{constructing-data-and-the-model}}

During preprocessing of the data, an interesting artifact was
encountered; When users were removed from the dataset that either liked
or disliked a movie, it was clearly shown that it occurred much more
often that user gave a 4/5 star rating to a movie than a 1/2 star
rating. This is interesting to keep in mind, as this might pose a
potential bias in the dataset.

To give a weight to the edges in terms of importance, we calculate the
weight according to a formula:

\[weight = max((\frac{no. of mutual liked movies}{
no. of liked movies})*100) \]

\hypertarget{results-1}{%
\paragraph{Results}\label{results-1}}

We have generated results for different (filtered) versions of the
dataset. The results are explained and shown below.

\hypertarget{more-than-120-reviews}{%
\subparagraph{More than 120 reviews}\label{more-than-120-reviews}}

In order to get a feeling of the QAP regression model, and to get
initial results in a reasonable amount of time, we first did the
analysis on users who had 120 reviews in total(like and dislike) or
more. The results are shown in the figure below.

\includegraphics[width=11.86in]{results120plus}

As can be seen from the figure, the QAP regression model explains only
6\% of the variation in the like/dislike interaction network for movies
when looking at liked movie ratings. When looking at disliked movie
ratings, it becomes even less: 4\%.

\hypertarget{more-than-100-reviews}{%
\subparagraph{More than 100 reviews}\label{more-than-100-reviews}}

Next, we decreased the filter threshold for the number of ratings that
users have given in the dataset. This increased the amount of datapoints
in the dataset. So, we had a dataset with users who had 100 reviews in
total (like and dislike) or more, and ran the analysis. The results are
shown in the figure below.

\includegraphics[width=12.06in]{results100plus}

As can be seen from the figure, the QAP regression model explains only
9\% of the variation in the like/dislike interaction network for movies
when looking at liked movie ratings. When looking at disliked movie
ratings, it becomes even less: 6\%.

\hypertarget{more-than-80-reviews}{%
\subparagraph{More than 80 reviews}\label{more-than-80-reviews}}

Because of the improved results in the last section, we decreased the
filter threshold for the number of ratings that users have given in the
dataset even more. This again increased the amount of datapoints in the
dataset, and we did the analysis on users who had 80 reviews in total
(like and dislike) or more. The results are shown in the figure below.

\includegraphics[width=11.78in]{results80plus}

As can be seen from the figure, the QAP regression model explains 14\%
of the variation in the like/dislike interaction network for movies when
looking at liked movie ratings. When looking at disliked movie ratings,
it again becomes a bit less: 10,4\%.

\hypertarget{more-than-60-reviews}{%
\subparagraph{More than 60 reviews}\label{more-than-60-reviews}}

For the last time, we decreased the filter threshold for the number of
ratings that users have given in the dataset. This also increased the
amount of datapoints in the dataset, and we ran the analysis on users
who had 80 reviews in total (like and dislike) or more. The results are
shown in the figure below.

\includegraphics[width=12.29in]{results60plus}

As can be seen from the figure, the QAP regression model explains 17\%
of the variation in the like/dislike interaction network for movies when
looking at liked movie ratings. When looking at disliked movie ratings,
the model can explain 13\% of the variation. Th finally gave us the
feeling that we are building somewhat meaningful models.

We even wanted to go a step further and decrease the filter threshold
for the number of ratings that users have given to 40. But this would
yield a dataset that was too large to analyse, as it costs 25+ hours to
run an analysis on it.

\hypertarget{findings-in-relation-to-hypothesis}{%
\paragraph{Findings in relation to
hypothesis}\label{findings-in-relation-to-hypothesis}}

When relating our findings to our aforementioned hypothesis, we see that
it is possible to build models that somewhat can explain the variance in
the network in a significant way. However, we can clearly see that more
data is not always giving better explanations.

Also, it very interesting to see that liking movies says more about
which movies you might dislike, than vice versa. An explanation for this
might be that we saw in the data that there were more positive ratings
than negative ratings, which could explain that disliking defines a more
specific taste that is better detectable.

What remains an open problem, is that we assume that a frequent reviewer
gives a rating to a movie after watching it. However, we don't have
information on (re-)viewers that watch a movie but don't give a rating
afterwards. This is difficult to overcome as we simply don't have data
available on this matter.

\textbf{\emph{Can you give suggestions for future work in this area?}}
For future research it could be beneficial to dive more into the
literature and find out more about what is already known in order to
give a stronger reasoning behind the explanatory variables used in the
analysis. Also, it would be interesting to look into more recent data as
streaming services are widely used nowadays and the variation of users
is maybe larger now.
