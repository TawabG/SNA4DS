# Data
Get the data from here: https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data
This is in the gitignore so the repository will not be too big

# Data exploration and Slicing
The exploration that is used to decide how much of the data should be sliced away and how it is done is taken from this kernel: https://www.kaggle.com/laowingkin/netflix-movie-recommendation
